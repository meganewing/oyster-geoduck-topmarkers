## comparing top marker genes in oysters and geoduck samples

read in data
```{r}

geoduck <- read.delim("../data/geoduck_topmarkers_annot.txt")
head(geoduck)

oyster <- read.csv("../data/CPbla_topmarkers_annot.csv")
head(oyster)
```

 merge by common genes

```{r}

compare <- merge(x = oyster, y = geoduck, by.x = "gene_id", by.y = "LOC")
head(compare)

```

write to file
```{r}

write.csv(compare, "../output/top_marker_oyster_geoduck_common.csv")
